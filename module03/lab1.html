            <p>The Chihuahua is a <strong>Mexican breed</strong> of a <strong>Toy Dog</strong>.
                The name <em>Chihuahua</em> came from the Mexican state <em>Chihuahua</em> and it's the smallest <em>dog breed</em> 
                in the world. The <em>Chihuahua</em> history says that It has come from <em>Native American Dogs</em> 
                entered <em>North America</em> from Siberia roughly 10,000 years ago, and were then isolated for 9,000 years until the arrival of the <em>Europeans</em>.
                Chihauhua have a very small head and said to have an "Apple-head" or "Apple-Dome" skull formation.
                Chihuahuas can come in many different colors like brown, white, tan, and many more. They can also be very
                fluffy or they can have small hairs. Personally, my <em>Chihuahua</em> is a small dog but has many different features than other <em>Chihuahuas</em>.
                My Chihuahua is a dark brown color with tan some tan around it's body. He also has white fur on his chest.
                My Chihuahua can look very similar to another <em>Dog Breed</em> like a <strong> Rottweiler</strong>. 
                Like many other small dogs, Chihuahuas can act very aggressive toward other people or other dogs.
